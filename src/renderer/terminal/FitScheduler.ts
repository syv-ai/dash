/**
 * Debounced fit scheduling for terminal containers that animate and collapse.
 *
 * The drawer collapse/expand animates over ~200ms, so resize events arrive in
 * bursts and the fit must wait out the transition. The trap: when the
 * container reaches a hidden height, any fit scheduled by an earlier
 * (still-visible) event must be CANCELLED — if it fires against a hidden
 * container, FitAddon clamps to its 1-row minimum and squashes the PTY,
 * leaving an extra prompt line behind after every collapse/expand cycle.
